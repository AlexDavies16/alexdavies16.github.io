First, Why Mushrooms?

Truth be told, I did not like mushrooms until about four years ago. 25 years of my life have been spent avoiding fungi. Shittakes? Horrible. Portobellos? Even worse. I could not make myself enjoy the taste. That was until I met my partner, who, when we first met, spoke so highly of mushrooms that I lied and said I also loved them. A silly thing to lie about, I know. Caught in this entanglement, I asked a knowledgeable fungi person what mushroom they would recommend to someone who didn’t like mushrooms at all. Their answer was the chanterelle. 

I bought a pound and ran home to cook them. To my delight, the chanterelles tasted heavenly. An earthiness mixed with a deep buttery flavor. I decided I really liked mushrooms from then on out.  My partner & I have since foraged in the local forests and done plenty of reading on different native mushrooms. I’m happy I lied. 
So, I’ve made this project partially out of personal interest, and partially out of love. 

What is this project about?

This project was inspired after I picked up a field guide for wildflowers and other plants that grow on the side of the highway. It was formatted like a field guide, but written with such a tender passion for the small plants one might not notice while on the road. I’ve looked at other field guides before and never saw any flourishing text or storytelling attached to a plant. I spent some time flipping through the different field guides and reference books in my apartment and found that everyone wrote slightly differently about the same topic, whether it be plant, fungi, or animal. It made me wonder how many ways we could write about a single object, what other ideas or attachments could be made to something in nature that isn’t just an identifying description. 

At the most basic level, this project’s use is to understand the different ways that we know and describe mushrooms, a cultural property of an object. In reading through several field guides, pop science, non-fiction, and children's books, and putting them through tools like Voyant and Cytoscape, I’ve found a variety of ways to know a mushroom in the forest that’s more than its identifying features. For example, we can view it as a piece of culinary delight, examining the different words people use to describe flavor or ingredients often used in relation. Or as an important piece of folklore across time and different countries. We can examine how poison is described, the odd words that relate to death or distress in relation to a mushroom.
	
Data Collection

How were my mushrooms selected?

In total, this project focuses on eight mushrooms: chanterelles, morels, king boletes, chicken-of-the-woods, fairy rings, fly agarics, death caps, and turkey tails. While my selection is partially personal preference, all of these mushrooms can be found in the Northeast.  I took into consideration which mushrooms are popular to forage and which mushrooms are popular in art and literature. What mushrooms could someone easily, or not so easily, find in the woods near their house. 
How were my source materials collected?

My book selections are split into two parts: field guides and humanities-based literature. Field guides were mainly selected on a regional basis. I live, study, and collect fungi in the Northeastern region of the US. This project is based on what can be found from the top tip of Maine, all the way down to New Jersey. Therefore, nearly all of my field guides focus on this specific area.

Humanities based books are based on relation. I started my selection by referencing what books the local mushroom shop offered in their library area. I then checked out what books mycological/ nature societies recommended for reading outside of field guides. Finally, I went through all available books within the Minuteman library system for potential source uses. 

I aimed to find books that mentioned each of my selected mushrooms. Ideally, each book should mention each mushroom within my list. Within that, each source should have a minimum of two passages to pull from on each mushroom. While this was not always possible, I tried to minimize any issues by finding other sources with a larger selection of choice passages to make up for it. 

Issues with Collection:
I did run into a few issues while pulling all of my data together. Within children’s literature, as some were more image based rather than text. Some books did not mention Death Caps or Fly Agaric mushrooms. Fairy Rings were either mentioned as the specific mushroom (Marasmius oreades) or referenced the shape of the mushroom formation, which required close attention in pulling passages. Chicken of the Woods and King Boletes were often referenced by other names, like Sulphur Shelf or Porcini. I had to pay strict attention to Morels, since many kinds fall under the mushroom’s umbrella, and held the chance to refer to a Gray or Black Morel instead of a yellow. Similar inconsistencies happened with collecting Chanterelle data.

How were my passages selected?
	For the most part, any passage that references a mushroom was selected for this project. From the smallest, “Some people use this fancy mushroom [turkey tails] as jewelry,” to a passage that is several sentences long. On some occasions, a passage is left out for redundancy, like if a book references chanterelles as the same shade of yellow on separate pages. Similarly, if a passage is not specifically focused on a mushroom but more of the genus or family at large, this was also not used for data collection. Passages from children’s literature are often one or two sentences long, where something from non-fiction might span 6 sentences.  Within longer passages, some are broken into separate sentences due to topic changes within the section. I wanted to have as many unique passages from a book as possible. However, the long passages from Fungepedia are never broken into smaller pieces, as this is more of an encyclopedia entry with a distinct topic at hand. Similarly, all field guides are kept fully intact, as all passages are mainly composed of fragments.
How were these passages categorized?
	This project uses four different types of books to pull passages. Below, I’ve described each type for users to understand the difference. With the exception of children’s literature, the other three categories technically fall under the large umbrella of “non-fiction”. For the purpose of the project, I want to keep things specific. For example, while non-fiction would generally cover field guides and pop science as a genre at large, I want to draw distinction through styling. I also attempt to ascribe a use-meaning to each book. What is someone getting out of picking up a field guide compared to a pop science book?  
As for thematic categories, these highlight the wide variety of ways that we know, see, and interact with mushrooms. By going through each book and specific passage, I’ve found relational patterns and unique methods of writing of these selected fungi. Ranging from culinary to folklore, to medicinal and historical, I’ve tried to be precise in extrapolating a specific topic. Included below is a list and explanation for each thematic category used in this project so far. These categories still feel partially insufficient to the scope of this project, and I want to get even finer detailed categories for this project over the next few months. Some of these categories are quite large, like “Identification” and “Growing Space”; I hope to perform an even closer analysis on these to tease out the variety of descriptions of color or relationships between mushrooms and nature.

Categories:
Book Types

Field Guide: Book that focuses on scientific evidence and observation. Generally gives the reader information such as taxonomy,  physical description, habitat, and other basic facts. Written in a straightforward manner.The use of this book is to help readers identify mushrooms.

Pop Science: Book that includes aspects of scientific and cultural relevance of mushrooms. The structure is similar to field guides or encyclopedias.  Will include scientific information, but the structure of the book relies on situating the mushroom in everyday life. Written in an inviting form, almost like storytelling. Use of this book is to get users interested in mushrooms without alienating newcomers.

Children’s Literature: Book written mainly for kids, and the parents that are reading them aloud. Includes basic information about mushroom identification, like colors, shape, and fun facts. Science is explained in enough detail for a child between 5-10 to understand. Includes personal anecdotes. Generally avoids too much information on toxic mushrooms. Written to introduce children into topics of the natural world. 

Non-Fiction: Mainly long form essays based on personal experience, as well as relationships to nature. Aspects of science are included in this writing, but more focused on the context of a mushroom. The goal of this book is to provide a different way of looking at a mushroom.

Mushroom Categories
Art: Passages that reference various forms of media in relation to mushrooms.  This category is not limited to the fine arts, such as painting or photography, but also video games, music, greetings cards, advertisements and film. Anything that mentions an image of a mushroom for entertainment purposes. 

Animals: Passages that mention animals in relation to mushrooms. This includes the mention of animals consuming, hunting, or culturally connected to any of the fungi in this project.

Culinary: Passages that focus on the act of preparing and eating any of the mushrooms in this project. This includes passages focused on meal ideas, recipes, preparation tips, and various ingredients that complement fungi.

Identification: Passages that describe physical attributes used to identify a mushroom in the wild. Passages can be extremely detailed, including the height, spore print, stalks, and gills. Or can be incredibly generalized, based on colors or old sayings.

Historical: Passages that reference a mushroom in the context of an event or past use. Generally focused on references prior to the 1990s, leaning more towards Ancient Rome to the early 20th century to be specific.

Look alikes: Passages that focus on mushrooms and their look alikes, both toxic and safe. Some passages focus on similar looking mushrooms from the same genus, ones that you can eat. Others focus on potentially deadly mistakes made from confusing two mushrooms. 

Cultural: Passages centered on the space that mushrooms occupy in the zeitgeist. This focuses on how people see the mushroom in the context of their space, like a statewide mushroom festival or a holiday icon–  a specific use outside of culinary arts. Religion is also included in this section, as it focuses on specific practices that one religion or people may use a mushroom for. 

Folklore: Passages focused on the mythos surrounding a mushroom. This category tends to lean towards Europe & Russia as the main folklore providers, ranging from stories about fairies to witchcraft. 

Minor Poison: Passages that focus on lesser instances of poisoning that come with eating a mushroom. This includes food poisoning/GI issues, external chemicals, incorrect preparation, and other issues that come from consuming a mushroom. Basically, the mushroom won’t kill you, but you will regret eating it. 

Deadly Poison: Passages that focus on mushrooms with deadly potential. Mentions of toxic chemical structure, how the poison works on the human body, and a variety of deaths caused by mushroom consumption over time. 

Hallucinatory: Passages centered on mushroom induced hallucinations and its other side effects. Mushrooms mentioned in this category do not fall under the umbrella of general use for psychedelics. The category focuses more on experiments, religious practices, and historical uses. 

Literature: Passages that focus on references made to literary allusions to mushrooms in books, this also includes authors. Books do not need to be fiction, as scientific and other genres will be applied here. This category also includes poetry, newspaper articles, and jokes! (And who doesn’t love a good joke?)

Economic Value: Passages that recognize a mushroom as monetary value. These paragraphs or sentences mention mushrooms in the context of money, capitalism, economics, costs, labor, and trade.

Naming: Passages that focus on how a mushroom is named, or what we lovingly call it. While this category may include how specific taxonomic names came to be, this is mainly structured around the cultural names given to a mushroom. From North America to Europe, Africa to Asia, names given by specific countries are covered here. 

Growing Space: Passages centered on the relationship between mushrooms and their environment. This category contains the specific trees that mushrooms enjoy, as well as the land surrounding them. No human interaction is found here. 

Medicinal:  Passages that focus on the use of mushrooms as a medical device. Includes eastern & western practices, as well as other non-traditional ways of using mushrooms to heal/aid in medical situations. 

Foraging: Passages that recognize the physical interaction between humans and mushrooms. Not to be confused with labor, but seeking out mushrooms as a hobby. It is the act of looking for a mushroom  in the woods and bringing it home. Often writing with a loving, caring emotion towards the fungi. 

Tools Used for this Project

Voyant
	I chose Voyant for its user-friendliness and easy access for any age user, as accessibility is the utmost importance to this project. I wanted a tool that would be able to perform basic analysis of my spreadsheet of data. I found the distinctive word section in the summary to be incredibly helpful for forming the base of this project. 
Eventually, I will visualize a few other aspects of Voyant, but some of this data will be used for writing my thesis. All of the data gained from using Voyant can be found on my Github.  I want users to be able to play around with the tool on their own. 

Cytoscape
	The network for this project is formed through Cytoscape. This tool was chosen for its use in forming easy to interact with visualizations of my data.. After a few weeks of trial and error, I realized that the best use of this tool would come from post-Voyant analysis. Using the most unique distinct words from each category, I created a visualization of the data and a way to see any potential connections between categories. 
	Users will be able to scroll through the Cytoscape visualization via my Github page. Right now, it is slightly difficult to navigate. I am working on trying to create a more friendly way to insert the network onto my page.

Github
	This data is held on a Github repository. I want users to be able to see how I organized all of my passages, in hopes that others might make a similar project for mushrooms in their area or ones that are important to them. I also want this work to be easily accessible to potential future collaborators. 
	The project itself is hosted on Github pages, where users will be able to access the visualization and analysis of these mushrooms. In the spirit of environmentalism, I want this project focused on the outdoors to have a minimal effect on the world around us.
