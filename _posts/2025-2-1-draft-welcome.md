Hello, and welcome to my mushroom data page! It's great to see you here.

Here's a map of what this page has to offer:
About is simply about me, the person writing this.
Methodology includes a (draft) write up of what this project is, how I went about making this, and what you can do with it.
Data is an interactive spot where you can visualize the language about mushrooms through my categories.

I know this page is a little shabby, but I've got grand plans on fixing it up.

Hope you enjoy!
